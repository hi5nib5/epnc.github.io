	<h1> RENEWABLE ENERGEY POWER GRID </h1>
	 
	<p>Electrical power needs captured energy to meet the challenges of the future. Grid instability caused by intermittent renewable generation means that captured energy in the form of batteries will form the basis of power grid stability, reduce costs and generate innovative income streams in the future.</p>


	<p>EPNC Energy has the knowledge and experience of the battery storage market to advise its customers on how to proceed in a cost-effective way.</p>
